\abstract{Evolution is often viewed as a fundamental characteristic of life, typically involving replicating entities capable of adaptation and governed by fitness-driven selection. In this paper, we explore a weaker concept of abiotic evolution, demonstrating how randomness, feedback loops, and population dynamics can drive the emergence of stable, ordered patterns without reliance on specific physical laws. Through abstract, non-physical systems of symbolic tokens governed by local probabilistic interactions and fitness-based selection, we illustrate how imbalances in frequency and fitness create feedback loops that produce emergent structures. This study highlights that emergent complexity is a universal property of systems with probabilistic interactions and selection mechanisms, offering a new perspective on the origins of pattern formation beyond the constraints of physical determinism.}

\section{Introduction}

This paper considers a population of elements \( A, B, C, \dots \) capable of forming compounds through local interactions. The stability of these compounds determines their persistence in the population. Over successive generations, the system undergoes a form of weak natural selection where stability, serving as a proxy for fitness, drives the evolution of the population. Using a probabilistic framework, this study demonstrates how frequency imbalances and fitness-based selection lead to the emergence of stable patterns, creating a dynamic that drives the population towards a more ordered state.


In a simple case of just three elements: {A, B, C}, assume that compounds including B are more stable than those without B. Thus AB, BC, ABC, have a higher stability than AC or pure A or C. In such a scenario, stable B-compounds will persist over multiple generations, while the unstable patterns will quickly dissipate. Although there is no individual replication or inheritance in the abiotic case, more stable patterns will interact more frequently based on their relative frequency in the population. The result is the same as fitness proportionate selection (aka roulette wheel selection).

The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and highlight why it is important. It should define the purpose of the work and its significance. The current state of the research field should be reviewed carefully and key publications cited. Please highlight controversial and diverging hypotheses when necessary. Finally, briefly mention the main aim of the work and highlight the principal conclusions. As far as possible, please keep the introduction comprehensible to scientists outside your particular field of research. Citing a journal paper \cite{ref-journal}. Now citing a book reference \cite{ref-book1,ref-book2} or other reference types \cite{ref-unpublish,ref-communication,ref-proceeding}.

\subsection{System Description and Dynamics}
Consider a population of elements \( E = \{A, B, C, \dots \} \). Each element has a frequency \( f_X \) such that \( \sum_{X \in E} f_X = 1 \).
Compounds \( C_{XY}, C_{XYZ}, \dots \) form through probabilistic interactions, with stability \( S(C) \) determining persistence.
Fitness \( F(C) \) is proportional to stability \( S(C) \), such that \( F(C) = S(C) \).
Frequencies evolve as:
\[
f_X(t+1) = \frac{\sum_{C \ni X} F(C) \cdot P(C)}{\sum_{X'} \sum_{C \ni X'} F(C) \cdot P(C)},
\]
where \( P(C) \) reflects interaction probabilities.

\subsection{Emergent Behavior}
- Stable compounds persist, biasing the system towards elements involved in these structures.
- Feedback loops reinforce stability, creating self-organizing patterns.

\subsection{Elements and Interactions}
- Denote the population of elements as:
\[
E = \{A, B, C, \dots\}.
\]
- Each element \( X \) has a frequency \( f_X \), such that:
\[
\sum_{X \in E} f_X = 1.
\]

\subsection{Compounds}
- Pairs (or higher-order combinations) of elements can form compounds \( C_{XY}, C_{XYZ}, \dots \), with stability \( S(C) \) as a defining property.
- Stability \( S(C) \) measures how long the compound persists before dissociation.

\subsection{Generation}
- At each generation, elements interact, forming compounds with probabilities influenced by their frequencies.

- Define the fitness \( F(C) \) of a compound as proportional to its stability \( S(C) \):
\[
F(C) = S(C).
\]
- Stable compounds persist longer and contribute more to the next generation's composition by dissociating into their constituent elements.

\subsection{Compound Formation}
- The probability of forming a compound \( C_{XY} \) is proportional to:
\[
P(C_{XY}) \propto f_X \cdot f_Y \cdot g(C_{XY}),
\]
where \( g(C) \) is a function reflecting constraints such as geometry or energy barriers.

\subsection{Survival and Contribution}
- More stable compounds contribute their elements back into the system with higher weights when they dissociate, biasing frequencies toward constituents of stable compounds.

\subsection{Frequency Update Equation}
The frequency \( f_X^{(t+1)} \) at generation \( t+1 \) is updated as:
\[
f_X^{(t+1)} = \frac{\sum_{C \ni X} F(C) \cdot P(C)}{\sum_{X'} \sum_{C \ni X'} F(C) \cdot P(C)},
\]
where \( P(C) \) is the probability of forming \( C \) in the previous generation.

\subsection{Selection Bias}
- Over time, elements involved in forming more stable compounds \( (C_{XY}, C_{XYZ}, \dots) \) will increase in frequency.

\subsection{Stochastic Drift}
- Elements with initially low frequencies may be outcompeted if they fail to form stable compounds.

\subsection{Emergent Behavior}
- The system self-organizes toward a distribution of elements and compounds that maximizes overall stability.

\subsection{Analogy to a Roulette Wheel}
- Think of \( f_X \) as the relative "size" of \( X \)'s slot on the roulette wheel.
- At each generation:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Higher \( f_X \) increases the likelihood of \( X \)'s participation in compounds.
      \item Fitness \( F(C) \) amplifies the impact of stable compounds, effectively "rigging" the wheel in favor of elements contributing to stability.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Stationary Distribution}
- If \( F(C) \) and \( g(C) \) are constant, the system may converge to a stationary distribution \( f_X^* \), biased toward elements forming the most stable compounds.

\subsection{Entropy Reduction}
- Initially random distributions \( f_X^{(0)} \) will evolve, reducing entropy as stable configurations dominate.

\subsection{Evolutionary Dynamics}
- The system exhibits a weak form of natural selection, where fitness is defined as stability rather than reproductive success.

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is the example 1 of equation:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

This is the example 2 of equation:
\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}
\begin{equation}
a = b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z
